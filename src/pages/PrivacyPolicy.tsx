                        SECTION 6 LLC (“we”, “us”, or “our”) values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our website or our auto detailing services (both mobile and studio).
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>
                        We may collect information you voluntarily provide when you schedule an appointment, request a quote, or contact us — such as your name, phone number, email address, vehicle details, and location (for mobile services).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may also automatically collect certain non-personal information about your device and usage when you visit our website, such as IP address, browser type, and pages viewed.

                        We may use trusted third-party services to help us operate our business — such as online scheduling tools, payment processors, or customer communication platforms. These third parties may collect and process your information according to their own privacy policies.
