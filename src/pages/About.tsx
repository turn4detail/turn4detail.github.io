          <p>
            Hi there! I’m Steven, the owner here at <span className="font-semibold">Section 6 Detailing</span>. Based in Kent, Washington,
            I proudly serve the surrounding areas with top-quality auto detailing services.
            What began as a hobby detailing my first car has since evolved into a true passion—one that eventually
            led to the creation of Section 6 Detailing.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a small, independent business, my mission is simple: <span className="font-semibold">to provide exceptional detailing that enhances and
              preserves your vehicle’s beauty.</span> I treat every car with the precision and care it deserves, using only
            professional-grade products to deliver flawless results.
          </p>

          <p>
            I understand that not everyone is looking for the cheapest detailing—they want the best value for their money.
            That’s why I focus on delivering superior quality without breaking the bank. My services reflect meticulous craftsmanship,
            ensuring your vehicle looks its absolute best while protecting your investments.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m always working to perfect my craft. Right now, I’m learning headlight restoration, engine bay detailing,
            and paint touch-ups. If you're interested in these services, just let me know!
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you for choosing <span className="font-semibold">Section 6 Detailing</span>—I look forward to making your car shine!

          <div>
            <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl mb-2">What are the benefits of getting my car detailed?</h3>
            <p>
              Regular detailing helps <span className="font-semibold">preserve your vehicle’s value</span> by protecting the paint, interior, and overall condition.
              It removes dirt, grime, and contaminants that can cause long-term damage, enhances the car’s appearance,
              and <span className="font-semibold">can even improve resale value</span>. A properly detailed car also provides a cleaner, healthier driving environment
              by eliminating dust, bacteria, and allergens.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl mb-2">How do I know which detail package I need?</h3>
            <p>
              The right detail package depends on your car's current condition and your goals.
              If you're a new customer, I highly recommend starting with a <span className="font-semibold">Step 1 Detail</span> to restore your vehicle’s condition.
              This also qualifies you for my <span className="font-semibold">maintenance program</span>, allowing you to book recurring Step 1 Details
              at a discounted rate every 1–6 months (180 days).
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              For vehicles with <span className="font-semibold">deep stains, moderate swirl marks, or heavy buildup</span>, a more intensive option like the <span className="font-semibold">Step 2 Detail</span> is ideal.
              This service provides a deep interior clean and aims to reduce swirls by ~60% while enhancing gloss.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              If you’re unsure which package is best, feel free to reach out anytime—I’m happy to help!

          <div>
            <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl mb-2">What are your hours?</h3>
            <p>
              I operate by <span className="font-semibold">appointment only</span> to give each vehicle the time and attention it deserves.
              Contact me to schedule a session that works for you!

          <div>
            <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl mb-2">Do you offer mobile services or studio services?</h3>
            <p>
              Currently, I offer both <span className="font-semibold">mobile & studio detailing services</span>.
              However, the <span className="font-semibold">Step 3 & Step 4 Detail packages are studio-only services</span> because they require extensive time
              and controlled conditions to achieve the best results.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl mb-2">Do you provide your own water & electricity?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes! I typically do not require access to your water tap or electricity for most mobile detailing services.
              However, for <span className="font-semibold">bulk mobile detailing</span>, I may need access to ensure efficiency and consistency in the results.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl md:text-2xl mb-2">Where can I see your previous work?</h3>
